# My first `readme` file!

## General playing around
### I'm so excited
Hello world! This is my first `readme` file and also my first repository – well, it is even my first week with Github!

### I like lists
Some useful git commands I have already learned in this course:

* `git pull`
* `git clone`
* `git push`
* `git --version`

Wow, it's even formatted like code – now that's exciting!


### Pretty pictures make everything better

A very fancy picture of a flow cytometry facility at UZH! Here is also the link to the corresponding [website](https://www.cytometry.uzh.ch/en/analyzers.html).

### Even tables are easy
Here is a table of my top 3 favorite animals

| Place  | Animal | Coolness factor | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| **1**  | Ibeces  | live in the roughest mountain areas |
| **2**  | Marmots  | whistle to alarm their fellow buddies |
| **3**  | Baby goats  | are super cute |
